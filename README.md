##What is the ISE?
The Information Sharing Environment (ISE) broadly refers to the people, projects, systems, and agencies that enable responsible information sharing for national security.

The Congress established our office in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 as a result of the 9/11 Commission’s recommendation to build a better environment of information sharing. Therefore, we are working to build the “Information Sharing Environment,” or ISE. The ISE is not an office, network, or database; it is a term that we use to refer to the people, projects, systems, and agencies that enable responsible information sharing for national security.

Our main authority comes from our role as a co-chair (with the National Security Staff) of the White House Information Sharing and Access Interagency Policy Committee, where we convene agencies and the private sector to advance information sharing agreements. We also work to develop and support best practices in information sharing and safeguarding for law enforcement, public safety, homeland security, intelligence, defense, foreign affairs, and private sector communities at the federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial government level.
